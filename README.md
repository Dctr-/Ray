# Ray Programming Language Design

Ray is designed to be a general purpose, high-level, object oriented, statically typed, compiled programming language. The language aims to bridge the gap between simplicity and efficiency by bolstering impressive speeds with minimal barriers for entry so newer and veteran programmers alike can quickly pick up the syntax and begin creating high quality and high efficiency code. The language has no pointers, no manual memory management, minimal constructs, and a clear concise syntax. It brings the simplicity of a language like Python while providing the efficiency of a language like Java.
